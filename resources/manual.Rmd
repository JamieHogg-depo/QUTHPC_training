## QUT HPC Manual

This document stands as a stripped back manual for successfully operating the Queensland University of Technologies (QUT) High Performance Computing (HPC) system for staff at the DOHWA. 

## Background

- I won't try to explain or teach Unix/Bash code
- I am not a programmer
- spaces matter
- Fantastic resources by Ethan Goan

## Logging in for the first time 

Open command prompt and type

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh <your_qut_id>@lyra.qut.edu.au
```

where you will replace `<your_qut_id>` with your personal QUT ID. Then hit ENTER. The console will then prompt you to enter your password. 
**IMPORTANT**: *While typing your password, the console will not show you any dots. It will appear as if the console is not recognizing that you're inputting your password. Be assured that it is.* 

Once you've typed you password and hit ENTER you will now be inside the lyra head node. Your screen might look something like the one below. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}

## Monitoring the status of jobs

The below command provides a summary of the current jobs and their status. 

```{bash eval = FALSE}
qstat -u n9401849
```

The monitoring screen looks like this,

```{bash eval = FALSE}
n9401849@lyra01:~> qstat -u n9401849

pbs:
                                                                 Req'd  Req'd   Elap
Job ID               Username Queue    Jobname    SessID NDS TSK Memory Time  S Time
-------------------- -------- -------- ---------- ------ --- --- ------ ----- - -----
5005627.pbs          n9401849 quick    asra1_Ast*    --    1   1    2gb 01:00 Q   --
5005628.pbs          n9401849 quick    asra1_CHD*    --    1   1    2gb 01:00 Q   --
```

where most of the columns are not particularly helpful (at least for beginners). The columns we're interested in are the `Req'd Memory` and `Req'd Time` columns which give the amount of memory and time requested in your bash script. If these don't look right, stop the job. We'll show you how to stop jobs later, but note that you'll need to know the `Job ID` to do so.  

The other column to be interested in is the `Elap Time` column. Once your job has started (indicated by the `S` column showing `R` for that job) the elapsed time column shows how long the job has been running for. Once `Elap Time` is equal to `Req'd Time` the job stops --- regardless if it has finished or not! For this reason it is always best to slightly overestimate the run time of your models.

When your models are running the `qstat` call will look like this.  

```{bash eval=FALSE}
n9401849@lyra01:~> qstat -u n9401849

pbs:
                                                                 Req'd  Req'd   Elap
Job ID               Username Queue    Jobname    SessID NDS TSK Memory Time  S Time
-------------------- -------- -------- ---------- ------ --- --- ------ ----- - -----
5005629.pbs          n9401849 quick    asra1_Ast*  47118   1   1    2gb 01:00 R 00:01
5005630.pbs          n9401849 quick    asra1_CHD*  47168   1   1    2gb 01:00 R 00:01
````
  
## The `.sub` script

```{bash, eval = FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines'}
#!/bin/bash -l
#PBS -N myjob 				// NAME of job on lyra
#PBS -l ncpus=1 			// number of cores - set to 1
#PBS -l mem=2GB 			// memory allocation for job
#PBS -l walltime=1:00:00	// time allocation for job
#PBS -e myjob_errors
#PBS -o myjob_output
```

## Choosing `walltime` and `mem`

Walltime is the total amount of time it will take to complete your job. This includes loading packages, data, compiling the model, summarising and saving. You must leave sufficient time for all these tasks to be complete as the HPC will stop the job once the `walltime` has been met. Like most of our scripts, the last job is always to save our results... this is often the task that can be 

## Understanding the output file

Here is an example of the corresponding output file that lyra creates when a job has stopped. In (almost!) all cases, lyra will create an output and error file regardless of whether the job was successful. Generally when I refer to success I mean the R script finished running and the required files were successfully saved.

## Understanding the error file

Here is an example of the corresponding error file that corresponds to a specific job.

As you can observe this provides some of the output from `R` like you would see in `Rstudio` on your local machine. 

The examples above are for successful jobs. Below is an example error script when a job is stopped early due to an error in `R`.

In the above example, the job was stopped early due to a directory issue. 

## Other errors

Sometimes an error will occur that is unique and potentially one that cannot be described in the standard error and output files. In these instances you will receive an email that may look like this. If this happens please contact me. In most cases, these are a result of an error in the HPC system.
